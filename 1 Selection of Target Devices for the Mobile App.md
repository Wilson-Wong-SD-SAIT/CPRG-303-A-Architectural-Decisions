# Selection of Target Devices for the Retail Mobile App

## Context

Our team is developing a mobile app for a retail company, and we need to decide on the app type. The app could be native, web, or hybrid.

## Decision

After careful consideration, we have decided to develop a native mobile app for both iOS and Android platforms. Our priority is to deliver a seamless user experience and optimal performance.

## Rationale

Choosing native development aligns with the retail company's emphasis on delivering a high-quality user experience. Native apps provide better performance, device-specific features, and a consistent feel across different devices. Targeting both iOS and Android platforms maximizes the potential user bases.

## Consequences

The decision ensures a polished and responsive user interface, meeting the company's goal of providing an exceptional user experience, including offline functionality and smooth navigation. However, it should be noted that native development cannot extend to web frameworks. Additional resources and efforts are required to maintain a separate web codebase.
