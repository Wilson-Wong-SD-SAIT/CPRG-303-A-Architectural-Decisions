# Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks for the Retail Mobile App 

## Context
The team needs to identify any additional frameworks or technology stacks required to meet the specific features and scalability needs of the mobile app.

## Decision
The team stresses the implementation of "Pillow" library in Phython for image optimization techniques for product images

## Rationale
The "Pillow" library fits with our assumped backend language Python. Hence, utilizing its image optimization techniques, such as archiving, formatting and resizing, ensures optimal performance and user experience for viewing photos originated from different sources and formats.

## Consequences
While these techniques' operation of the app requires additional development efforts and budgets, it is predicted to involve testing and validation for optimized product images inside User Interface in various and recurrent development phases.
